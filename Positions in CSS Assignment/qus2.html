        <th>Relative Positioning</th>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first
          positioned parent.
        </td>
        <td>
          Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td>
          When position:absolute is given to an element the element can be
          placed precisely where one wants to.
        </td>
        <td>
          When position:relative is given to an element without any other
          attributes (top, bottom, left, right) nothing will happen.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          The element is positioned nearest to the first relatively or
          absolutely positioned parent element.
        </td>
        <td>
          But when an attribute left:20px is added the element moves 20px to the
          right from its normal position. The element effects no other element
          on the layout. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap
          left by the element.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          When there is no parent element the absolutely positioned element is
          positioned directly to the HTML page itself.
        </td>
        <td>
          The child of this element can be positioned within this block only. So
          position:relative has its limitations.
